# Budg-It
Budget App built with JS. 

Users can add sources of income and expenses, and the app will calculate their total available budget, as well as the percentages of the individual expenses, and combined total percentage of expenses in relation to income.

## Technical Talk ##

Users create income and expense objects which are saved to a data structure (locally, this is not hosted), updating the UI in turn.

Users can delete income or expense objects by hovering over the specific item and clicking the delete icon, which removes the income or expense from the database and UI alike.
